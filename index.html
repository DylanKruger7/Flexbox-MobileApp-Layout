      Atkinson was born in Consett, County Durham, England, on 6 January 1955. The youngest of four brothers, his parents were Eric Atkinson, a farmer and company director, and Ella May, who married on 29 June 1945.

      <p>Atkinson was brought up Anglican, and was educated at Durham Choristers School, a preparatory school, and then at St Bees School. After receiving top-grades in science A levels, he secured a place at Newcastle University, where he received a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.</p>

      <p>Atkinson briefly embarked in doctoral work before devoting his full attention to acting.</p>

      <p>Atkinson starred in a series of comedy shows for BBC Radio 3 in 1979 called The Atkinson People.</p>

      <p>After university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for London Weekend Television in 1979 called Canned Laughter. Atkinson then went on to do Not the Nine O'Clock News for the BBC, produced by his friend John Lloyd. He featured in the show with Pamela Stephenson, Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith, and was one of the main sketch writers.</p>

      <p>Atkinson's other creation, the hapless Mr. Bean, first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for Thames Television. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened to a modern-day Buster Keaton, but Atkinson himself has stated that Jacques Tati's character Monsieur Hulot was the main inspiration.</p>

      <p>In November 2012, it emerged that Rowan Atkinson intended to retire Mr. Bean. "The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me — basically quite physical, quite childish — I increasingly feel I'm going to do a lot less of," Atkinson told The Daily Telegraph's Review.</p>
